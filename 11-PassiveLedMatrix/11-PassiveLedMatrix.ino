  Row-Column Scanning an 8x8 LED matrix with X-Y input

  This example controls an 8x8 LED matrix using two analog inputs.

  This example works for the Lumex LDM-24488NI Matrix. See
  https://sigma.octopart.com/140413/datasheet/Lumex-LDM-24488NI.pdf
  for the pin connections.

  For other LED cathode column matrixes, you should only need to change the pin
  numbers in the row[] and column[] arrays.

  rows are the anodes
  cols are the cathodes
  ---------

  Pin numbers:
  Matrix:
  - digital pins 2 through 13,
  - analog pins 2 through 5 used as digital 16 through 19
  Potentiometers:
  - center pins are attached to analog pins 0 and 1, respectively
  - side pins attached to +5V and ground, respectively
